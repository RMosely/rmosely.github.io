        Time is a precious commodity, especially if you're a system administrator. 

Networking For System Administrators
************************************
.. topic:: Summary

        If basic TCP/IP was hard, network administrators couldn’t do it. Servers 
        give sysadmins a incredible visibility into the network—once 
        they know how to unlock it.

        The AWK Programming Language is a well-known 1988 book written by 
        Alfred V. Aho, Brian W. Kernighan, and Peter J. Weinberger and published
